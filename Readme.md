# AgentInspect: Agentic AI for Manufacturing Visual Inspection

AgentInspect is a lightweight, explainable AI tool for visual part inspection. It uses OpenAI's CLIP to semantically compare test images against known good parts, flag anomalies, and provide traceable justifications. This system is designed for practical, scalable use in manufacturing quality control — including anodizing, casting, and more.
